This project uses the mnist data set to train a three layer neural network. The mnist data set contains handwritten numerals, the object is to detect accurately the written numerals in the testset.
My code allows for a 97.19% accuracy with a learning rate of 0.1 and epochs = 3.  

The data sets can be in the digital-recognizer competition, or the digital-recognition data set provided by Kaggle.  https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

The last few lines we've set the algorithm to attempt to recognize wild numbers that were captured with a cellphone from hand written images and a few images produced with Gimp.  The Gimp images did ok;however, the algorithm struggled with the photos form the cellphone.
